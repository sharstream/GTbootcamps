## Firebase Assignment - Train Scheduler (Basic - Recommended)

Because that Rock Paper Scissors Game is Too Damn Hard

### Overview

In this assignment, you'll create a train schedule application that incorporates Firebase to host arrival and departure data. Your app will retrieve and manipulate this information with Moment.js. This website will provide up-to-date information about various trains, namely their arrival times and how many minutes remain until they arrive at their station.

### Setup

- We'll leave that up to you -- however you like. Just make sure you're using Firebase to store data, GitHub to backup your project, and GithHub Pages to host your finished site.

### Instructions
- Make sure that your app suits this basic spec:

- When adding trains, administrators should be able to submit the following:
- Train Name
- Destination
- First Train Time -- in military time
- Frequency -- in minutes

- Code this app to calculate when the next train will arrive; this should be relative to the current time.
- Users from many different machines must be able to view same train times.
- Styling and theme are completely up to you. Get Creative!
