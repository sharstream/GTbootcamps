# **Instructions**

1. You need to create your mysql database (use the `characters_schema.sql` file to do so, and seed it with a couple of characters).  Make sure it is running when you run the app!
2. Create a `.env` file and add the fields used in `connection.js`.
3. `npm install`
4. Run `node server.js` or `nodemon server.js`.  Check it out at `localhost:3000`!
